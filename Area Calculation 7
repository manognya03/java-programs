problem:
Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in a square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

Input Format

First input: a side of a square in integer Second input: length of a rectangle in integer Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer Fourth input: radius of a circle in float

Constraints

1<=side of square <=10**9 1<=length of rectangle<=10**9 1<=breadth of rectangle<=10**9 1<=radius<=10**9

Output Format

The first output should be the area of a square in integer The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places
